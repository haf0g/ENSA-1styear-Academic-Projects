- **KNINECH Fatima Ezzahra**  
- **GARHOUM Hafid**  
- **EL HAOU Khadija**  

**Supervisor:**  
- **Prof. ATTAOUI Wissal**

## Project Steps
1. **System Preparation**  
   - Installation of necessary tools (e.g., Git).  
   - Configuration of user privileges and environment setup.  

2. **OpenStack Installation**  
   - Deployment using **DevStack** for simplified installation.  
   - Configuration of core components:  
     - **Keystone** (Authentication)  
     - **Glance** (Image Management)  
     - **Nova** (Compute Services)  
     - **Neutron** (Networking)  
     - **Cinder/Swift** (Storage)  

3. **Accessing OpenStack**  
   - Setting up the web interface for cloud management.  

4. **Network and Security Configuration**  
   - Creation of networks, subnets, and routers.  
   - Configuration of security groups and firewall rules.  
   - Allocation of floating IPs for external access.  

5. **Instance Deployment**  
   - Launching a MySQL database instance.  
   - Testing performance and security.  

## Key Features
- **Flexibility:** Customizable cloud infrastructure tailored to organizational needs.  
- **Security:** Robust network and security configurations to protect data.  
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduced operational costs compared to public cloud solutions.
